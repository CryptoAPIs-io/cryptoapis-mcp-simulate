# @cryptoapis-io/mcp-simulate

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 3167621: Security: the HTTP transport no longer serves unauthenticated callers with the operator's API key.

  Before, `--transport http --api-key <key>` listened on `0.0.0.0` and never authenticated the caller, so anyone who could reach the port could call every tool on the operator's key: spend their credits, and create, deactivate or delete their blockchain-event webhooks and HD-wallet syncs.

  - HTTP mode now listens on `127.0.0.1` by default, with DNS rebinding protection (Host header check).
  - Listening on a non-loopback address (`--host 0.0.0.0`) with a startup API key requires an auth token (`MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` or `--auth-token`); callers send `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Without one the server refuses to start.
  - New `--allowed-hosts` restricts the Host header on non-loopback binds.
  - Per-request key mode (no startup key) now rejects requests without an `x-api-key` header with 401.
  - Stateful HTTP mode keeps one session per client; previously only the first client could ever connect.

  Breaking: clients connecting from another machine or container must now start the server with `--host 0.0.0.0` and an auth token. Reported by Syed Anas Mohiuddin.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- c30c9b1: Fix `simulate_evm`: remove the misleading `blockchain` parameter and narrow `network`.

  The underlying OpenAPI endpoint's path is literally `/simulate-transactions/evm/ethereum/{network}` — Ethereum-only, not a `{blockchain}` template. The tool schema previously exposed a 9-chain `blockchain` enum (ethereum, ethereum-classic, binance-smart-chain, tron, polygon, avalanche, arbitrum, base, optimism) that was validated, logged, and then silently discarded — a call with `blockchain: "polygon"` was actually simulating on Ethereum the whole time, with no error or warning (BL-0197).

  `network` is narrowed from a 7-value enum to the two the endpoint actually supports: `mainnet`, `sepolia`.

  `mcp-shared`'s `system_info` simulate product-availability data corrected to match (Ethereum-only).
